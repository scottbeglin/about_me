  			<h1>Introduction</h1>
  			<p>I am an aspiring Front End developer with dreams of changing the world, one code at a time......or something like that. When I discoved the "World of Coding" I knew that I would dedicate the rest of my profesional career on this path.</p>
			<p>I have loved technology for as long as I can remember. I find it very rewarding to have grown up within this time of technological advancements. From gaming to how we analyze data, the world is changing before our eyes and I am very excited and honored to be a part of it....no matter how big or small that may be.</p>

 			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  			<p>My family and I reside in Lincoln, CA. Lincoln is located right outside of Sacramento and only an hour outside of Lake Tahoe.</p>
  			<p>I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and grew up in what is famously known as "the wine country". I am a Bay Area kid at heart and love my coastal fog and cool climate.

  			<h1>More About Me</h1>
  			<p>I spend my free time playing guitar and writing music. I have been playing music since I was a kid and it is something that I am very passionate about.</p>
  			<p>I am also an avid sports fan or better put I am a die hard San Francisco Giants fan. Last but not least I love to spend my time with my wife and 2 kids.</p>

    <section class= "job-section">
  			<h1>My Dream Job</h1>
  			<p>My dream job is fairly simple. I want to be happy in what I do and share it with others. I would like a job that provides well for my family. I would hope that this job provides stability and also challenges me every day.</p>
